# PWA-Text-Editor

## Description

This Text Editor is a single-page application that meets PWA standards and runs in the browser.  As a pwa the text-editor also functions offline.  In this application, I have implemented methods for getting and storing data into an IndexedDB database to an already existing application. This was completed through the use of the lightweight wrapper packaged idb. 
With this text editor a user has the ability to write code snippets and notes with or without an internet connection. The user can then retrieve their code at a later time for usage. 

## Installation
If one is interested in running this application in the editor, they will notice a client and server folder structure. The user can then run an 'npm run start' from the directory and they will see that the application starts up the back end and serves the client. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
The text editor has been deployed on Heroku and can be accessed with this URL: https://lit-cove-94025-19594710ad0b.herokuapp.com/
